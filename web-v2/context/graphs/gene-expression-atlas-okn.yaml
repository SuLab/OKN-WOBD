# Gene Expression Atlas OKN - GXA differential expression and contrasts
# Uses Study (not schema:Dataset) as primary entity; Disease via studies (EFO)

notable_relationships:
  - "Study to diseases via studies (EFO IRIs - e.g. EFO_0001461, EFO_0002460)"
  - "Contrast/Assay to tissue via biolink:has_attribute (UBERON IRIs)"
  - "Gene to organism via biolink:in_taxon (NCBITaxon IDs)"
  - "GeneExpressionMixin associations link contrast (subject) to gene (object) with log2fc, adj_p_value"
