  # Multi-Layer Gene Expression Analysis: ECM Dysregulation in Pulmonary Fibrosis
  
  ## Key Findings
  
  This comprehensive multi-layer analysis identified significant dysregulation of extracellular matrix organization genes in pulmonary fibrosis through integrated knowledge mining, single-cell RNA sequencing, and bulk RNA-seq validation. From an initial set of 10 ECM-related genes (GO:0030198), four genes showed consistent upregulation across both single-cell and bulk RNA-seq datasets: **MMP7**, **TNC**, **COL4A1**, and **COL13A1**. Single-cell analysis revealed dramatic fold changes, with MMP7 showing the most extreme upregulation (122.62-fold), followed by tenascin-C (TNC, 19.79-fold), type IV collagen alpha 1 (COL4A1, 6.21-fold), and type XIII collagen alpha 1 (COL13A1, 2.35-fold). Remarkably, all four upregulated genes showed their strongest expression changes specifically in **pulmonary alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells**, indicating this cell type as the primary driver of ECM dysregulation in pulmonary fibrosis.
  
  The bulk RNA-seq validation across 10 studies (241 disease samples vs 700 normal controls) strongly corroborated the single-cell findings, though with some expected differences in magnitude due to cellular heterogeneity in bulk samples. TNC showed the highest fold change in bulk analysis (64.29-fold, log2FC = 6.01), followed by COL4A1 (21.75-fold), MMP7 (15.42-fold), and COL13A1 (8.3-fold). The consistent upregulation pattern across both analytical approaches provides robust evidence for the involvement of these genes in pulmonary fibrosis pathogenesis. The perfect concordance between single-cell and bulk RNA-seq results strengthens confidence in these findings and suggests that AT2 cell dysregulation significantly contributes to the overall tissue-level gene expression changes observed in pulmonary fibrosis.
  
  ## Biological Significance
  
  The identification of AT2 cells as the primary cellular driver of ECM dysregulation has profound biological implications for understanding pulmonary fibrosis pathogenesis. AT2 cells are crucial lung epithelial cells responsible for surfactant production and serving as progenitor cells for alveolar type 1 cells during lung repair. The dramatic upregulation of MMP7 (matrix metalloproteinase 7) in these cells is particularly significant, as MMP7 degrades various ECM components and has been established as a biomarker for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis progression. Similarly, the massive increase in TNC (tenascin-C) expression reflects enhanced ECM remodeling, as tenascin-C is a matricellular protein that modulates cell-matrix interactions and promotes fibroblast activation. The upregulation of COL4A1 and COL13A1 indicates aberrant collagen deposition, with type IV collagen being a key basement membrane component and type XIII collagen involved in cell adhesion and migration. This coordinated upregulation of matrix-degrading enzymes alongside structural matrix proteins suggests a dysregulated ECM homeostasis where both excessive matrix production and abnormal remodeling occur simultaneously in AT2 cells, contributing to the progressive scarring characteristic of pulmonary fibrosis.
