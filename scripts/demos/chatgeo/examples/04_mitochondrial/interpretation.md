## Key Findings

This differential expression profile strongly indicates severe mitochondrial dysfunction with activation of multiple stress response pathways. The pronounced upregulation of FGF21 and GDF15, established biomarkers of mitochondrial disease, coupled with suppression of normal muscle structural proteins, suggests significant metabolic reprogramming and muscle fiber damage.

## Upregulated Pathways

**Mitochondrial stress signaling**: FGF21 (5.8-fold) and GDF15 (4.3-fold) are canonical mitochondrial stress hormones released during respiratory chain dysfunction. These factors coordinate systemic metabolic adaptations and are FDA-approved biomarkers for mitochondrial diseases.

**Metabolic reprogramming**: TREH (trehalase, 4.4-fold) indicates altered carbohydrate metabolism, while PPM1E (4.1-fold) suggests disrupted protein phosphatase regulation. These changes reflect cellular attempts to maintain energy homeostasis under mitochondrial compromise.

**Inflammatory/immune activation**: IFNG (3.9-fold) upregulation suggests inflammatory muscle infiltration, consistent with mitochondrial damage-associated molecular patterns triggering innate immunity. LAMP3 (3.5-fold) indicates lysosomal activation, possibly reflecting enhanced autophagy/mitophagy.

**Neural/synaptic dysfunction**: SCN1A (sodium channel, 3.4-fold) and multiple protocadherin genes (PCDHGC4, PCDHGC5) suggest neuromuscular junction abnormalities, consistent with mitochondrial myopathy affecting motor neurons and muscle innervation.

## Downregulated Pathways

**MHC class II suppression**: Dramatic downregulation of HLA-DRA (-7.2-fold), HLA-DRB5 (-3.6-fold), and HLA-C (-3.6-fold) indicates impaired antigen presentation, possibly reflecting muscle fiber dedifferentiation or metabolic prioritization away from immune surveillance.

**Hemoglobin/oxygen transport**: Multiple hemoglobin genes (FGF23 -6.0-fold, HBD -4.8-fold, HBG2 -3.7-fold) are severely suppressed. FGF23 downregulation is particularly significant as this phosphate-regulating hormone affects mitochondrial function and bone metabolism.

**Structural muscle proteins**: TUBB (β-tubulin, -6.1-fold) downregulation indicates cytoskeletal disruption, while KRT19 (keratin 19, -4.2-fold) suggests loss of muscle fiber structural integrity.

**Transcriptional machinery**: Multiple transcription factors (ZBTB20 -3.8-fold, FOSB -3.6-fold, NEUROD2 -4.0-fold) are suppressed, indicating broad transcriptional reprogramming and possible muscle fiber dedifferentiation.

## Biological Interpretation

This signature reflects classic mitochondrial myopathy pathophysiology. The robust upregulation of FGF21 and GDF15 confirms severe mitochondrial dysfunction, as these are the most reliable circulating biomarkers for primary mitochondrial diseases. The metabolic stress triggers compensatory mechanisms including alternative carbohydrate metabolism (TREH) and enhanced protein quality control.

The suppression of MHC class II genes and structural proteins suggests muscle fiber atrophy and dedifferentiation, consistent with chronic energy failure. The hemoglobin gene downregulation may reflect reduced oxygen utilization capacity due to respiratory chain defects, representing metabolic adaptation to impaired oxidative phosphorylation.

The inflammatory component (IFNG upregulation) aligns with emerging understanding that mitochondrial dysfunction triggers sterile inflammation through mtDNA release and other damage signals. This creates a vicious cycle where inflammation further impairs mitochondrial function.

## Caveats

Bulk RNA-seq averages expression across multiple cell types including muscle fibers, satellite cells, immune infiltrates, and vascular components. The strong inflammatory signature may partly reflect immune cell infiltration rather than purely myofiber changes. Pooling across samples may obscure patient-specific mitochondrial genetic defects. The single study design limits generalizability, though the signature strongly matches established mitochondrial disease biomarkers.
