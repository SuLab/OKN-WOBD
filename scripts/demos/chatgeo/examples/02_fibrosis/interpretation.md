## Key Findings

Pulmonary fibrosis shows a dramatic dysregulation pattern with 1,311 downregulated genes versus only 133 upregulated genes. The upregulated signature is dominated by inflammatory mediators and epithelial damage markers, while downregulated genes primarily reflect loss of normal lung epithelial cell functions and ciliary dysfunction.

## Upregulated Pathways

**Inflammatory signaling** is the dominant upregulated theme, with multiple cytokines and chemokines including IL36G, CXCL8 (IL-8), CXCL1, CCL20, IL11, and IL1RN. These represent classic pro-inflammatory and fibrotic mediators, with IL-8 and IL-11 being well-established drivers of pulmonary fibrosis progression.

**Epithelial damage and remodeling** markers are highly enriched, including MMP7 (matrix metalloproteinase-7), a key biomarker for IPF progression and epithelial injury. The tissue factor F3 indicates coagulation pathway activation, commonly seen in fibrotic lung disease.

**Cornified envelope formation** genes (SPRR1B, SPRR2E, SPRR2A, SPRR1A) suggest aberrant epithelial differentiation and keratinization, reflecting pathological epithelial remodeling. Antimicrobial peptides (DEFB4A, DEFB4B) indicate innate immune activation.

**Growth factors and signaling** include FGFBP1, IGFBP3, and SOX4, supporting altered developmental programs and fibroblast activation pathways central to fibrosis pathogenesis.

## Downregulated Pathways

**Ciliary function** shows massive downregulation with 51 genes involved in cilium movement, including structural components of motile cilia and axonemes. This reflects the well-known loss of mucociliary clearance in fibrotic airways.

**Normal epithelial cell identity** is severely compromised, as evidenced by plasma membrane and cell periphery gene downregulation (464 genes). This represents the fundamental epithelial cell dysfunction that characterizes pulmonary fibrosis.

**Chromatin structure** genes including multiple histone variants (H3-5, H2BC17, H4C1) and nucleosome components are downregulated, suggesting altered transcriptional programs and cellular reprogramming.

**Hematopoietic markers** like hemoglobin genes (HBA1), platelet factors (PF4, PPBP, ITGA2B), and blood cell-specific genes (TUBB1) are dramatically reduced, likely reflecting altered vascular perfusion and cellular composition in fibrotic tissue.

## Biological Interpretation

This gene signature captures the canonical pulmonary fibrosis disease mechanism: **epithelial injury driving inflammatory fibrotic remodeling**. The upregulated inflammatory mediators (IL-8, IL-11, MMP7) match established IPF biomarkers and therapeutic targets. MMP7 elevation is particularly significant as it's FDA-approved as a prognostic biomarker for IPF.

The massive downregulation of ciliary genes reflects the transition from functional respiratory epithelium to a dysfunctional, fibrotic tissue architecture. This aligns with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition hypothesis of pulmonary fibrosis, where normal epithelial cells lose their differentiated functions.

The cornified envelope genes suggest pathological squamous metaplasia, representing aberrant wound healing responses. The coagulation activation (F3) supports the coagulopathy-fibrosis connection established in IPF research.

Unexpectedly, the magnitude of gene downregulation (1,311 vs 133 upregulated) suggests that pulmonary fibrosis may be better characterized as a loss-of-function disease rather than purely inflammatory activation.

## Caveats

Bulk RNA-seq data averages expression across multiple cell types, potentially masking cell-type-specific changes crucial in fibrosis (e.g., fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition). The pooled analysis across 44 studies may introduce heterogeneity from different fibrosis subtypes (IPF, NSIP, etc.) and disease stages. Reduced vascular perfusion in fibrotic tissue could contribute to the apparent loss of hematopoietic gene expression through altered tissue composition rather than true cellular reprogramming.
