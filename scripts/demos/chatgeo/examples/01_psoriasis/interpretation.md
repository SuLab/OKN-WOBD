## Key Findings

This differential expression analysis reveals the characteristic molecular signature of psoriasis, dominated by hyperkeratinization, antimicrobial peptide production, and immune activation in lesional skin. The downregulated genes suggest suppression of normal tissue remodeling and developmental processes.

## Upregulated Pathways

**Antimicrobial Defense**: The most striking upregulation involves antimicrobial peptides, with multiple defensins (DEFB4A/B, DEFB103A/B) showing 5-8 fold increases. These are hallmark molecules of psoriatic lesions, providing innate immune defense against microbial invasion.

**Hyperkeratinization**: Late cornified envelope (LCE3A, LCE3D, LCE3E) and small proline-rich repeat (SPRR2A/B/D/E/F/G) genes show massive upregulation (5-7 fold). These structural proteins form the thickened, scaly plaques characteristic of psoriasis. CRCT1 and CNFN further support this hyperproliferative epidermal phenotype.

**S100 Inflammatory Proteins**: S100A7, S100A7A, and S100A9 are strongly upregulated (4-5 fold). These calcium-binding proteins are key inflammatory mediators in psoriasis, promoting keratinocyte proliferation and neutrophil recruitment.

**Immune Cell Recruitment**: Chemokines CCL17 (6.0 fold) and cytokines IL36A and IL36G (both ~5 fold) drive the inflammatory cascade. CCR7 upregulation suggests enhanced T-cell trafficking. The presence of CTLA4 indicates T-cell activation, while IDO1 (6.0 fold) reflects interferon-gamma signaling.

**Epithelial Barrier Function**: SLPI upregulation (4.5 fold) provides protease inhibition to protect the compromised barrier.

## Downregulated Pathways

**Extracellular Matrix Remodeling**: Major ECM components are suppressed, including fibronectin (FN1, -4.0 fold), indicating disrupted tissue architecture. SERPINE1 and SERPINE2 (serine protease inhibitors) are markedly downregulated (-5.4 and -3.6 fold), suggesting altered proteolytic balance.

**Vascular/Angiogenic Factors**: PTX3 (-6.8 fold) and DKK1 (-5.4 fold) downregulation may reflect altered vascular remodeling. GREM1 (-3.2 fold), a BMP antagonist, suggests disrupted morphogenetic signaling.

**Immune Regulation**: Natural killer cell markers (KLRC4, KLRK1, GZMK) are downregulated, potentially indicating impaired immune surveillance. XCL1 and CD96 downregulation suggests altered lymphocyte function.

**Developmental Programs**: Multiple developmental transcription factors (FOXD1, FOXD4L3) and structural proteins (MYH7) are suppressed, reflecting the shift from normal tissue homeostasis to inflammatory hyperproliferation.

## Biological Interpretation

This gene signature perfectly captures established psoriasis pathobiology. The upregulated genes represent the classic "psoriasis transcriptome" - hyperactive keratinocytes producing excessive structural proteins (LCE/SPRR family), antimicrobial peptides (defensins), and inflammatory mediators (S100 proteins, IL-36 cytokines). The IL-36/IL-17 axis, evidenced by IL36A/G upregulation, drives the chronic inflammatory cycle characteristic of psoriatic plaques.

The downregulation of ECM components and developmental regulators suggests that normal skin homeostasis is sacrificed for the hyperproliferative, inflammatory response. The suppression of natural killer cell markers may contribute to the chronic nature of psoriatic inflammation by reducing immune resolution mechanisms.

The 6-fold upregulation of IDO1 is particularly notable, as this enzyme catabolizes tryptophan in response to interferon-gamma, linking innate and adaptive immune activation. This confirms the established role of Th1/Th17 responses in psoriasis pathogenesis.

## Caveats

This analysis pools samples across 16 different psoriasis studies and 82 control studies, potentially introducing study-specific batch effects and varying disease severity. Bulk RNA-seq cannot distinguish between keratinocyte-intrinsic changes versus infiltrating immune cell contributions to the signature. The healthy controls may include diverse anatomical sites that differ from psoriatic lesion locations, and demographic factors (age, sex, medication use) are not controlled across the large sample aggregation.
