## Key Findings

This differential expression analysis reveals the classic molecular signature of psoriasis, characterized by massive upregulation of keratinocyte differentiation and immune activation genes. The results strongly match established psoriasis pathophysiology, with hyperkeratinization, antimicrobial peptide production, and T-cell mediated inflammation as dominant themes.

## Upregulated Pathways

**Keratinocyte Hyperproliferation and Differentiation**: The most prominent signal involves genes central to abnormal keratinocyte differentiation. Multiple small proline-rich proteins (SPRR2A/2B/2D/2F) and late cornified envelope genes (LCE3D, LCE3E) show extreme upregulation (4-6 fold), indicating the characteristic hyperkeratinization of psoriatic plaques. CRCT1, another cornification marker, is similarly elevated.

**Antimicrobial Peptide Response**: Multiple defensins (DEFB4A/4B, DEFB103A/103B) show the highest fold changes (4-6 fold), reflecting the skin's attempt to combat perceived microbial threats and the chronic inflammatory state typical of psoriasis.

**T-cell Activation and Immune Checkpoints**: Strong upregulation of T-cell markers including IL2RA (CD25), CTLA4, TIGIT, and BATF indicates robust T-cell activation. The transcription factor BATF is particularly important as it drives Th17 differentiation, a key pathway in psoriasis pathogenesis.

**Chemokine Signaling**: CXCR6 upregulation (5.8 fold) aligns with enhanced T-cell recruitment to inflamed skin, while IDO1 elevation suggests immunomodulatory responses.

## Downregulated Pathways

**Immediate Early Response Genes**: FOS and FOSB show strong downregulation (-3.4 and -3.3 fold respectively), along with NR4A1 and NR4A2. This pattern suggests dysregulated stress response and transcriptional programs in psoriatic skin.

**Innate Immune Cell Markers**: Multiple genes associated with myeloid cells and innate immunity are downregulated, including LILRA family members (LILRA1/3/5), FCN1, MNDA, and FPR1. This may reflect altered innate immune cell populations or activation states in chronic lesions.

**Platelet and Coagulation Factors**: PF4 and GP9 downregulation, along with reduced TUBB1 (platelet-specific tubulin), suggests altered hemostatic function, potentially related to vascular changes in psoriatic skin.

**Heat Shock Response**: HSPA1A downregulation indicates impaired cellular stress responses, which may contribute to keratinocyte dysfunction.

## Biological Interpretation

The gene expression signature perfectly recapitulates established psoriasis pathophysiology. The massive upregulation of keratinization genes (61 genes in the keratinization pathway) confirms the hyperproliferative, abnormally differentiating keratinocyte phenotype central to psoriatic plaques. The strong defensin upregulation reflects both antimicrobial responses and the chronic inflammatory milieu.

The immune signature is consistent with Th17/Th1-mediated inflammation, evidenced by T-cell activation markers (IL2RA, CTLA4) and the key Th17 transcription factor BATF. The downregulation of immediate early genes like FOS/FOSB may reflect chronic inflammatory adaptation or altered keratinocyte stress responses.

Interestingly, the downregulation of innate immune markers contrasts with the strong adaptive immune activation, possibly indicating a shift from acute innate responses to chronic adaptive inflammation in established lesions.

## Caveats

This analysis pools samples across 16 psoriasis studies and 23 control studies, potentially introducing study-specific batch effects and clinical heterogeneity (disease severity, treatment status, anatomical site). Bulk RNA-seq averages expression across all cell types in skin biopsies, obscuring cell-type-specific responses that single-cell approaches would reveal. The strong concordance with known psoriasis biology provides confidence in the results, but subtle pathway differences between studies or patient subgroups may be masked.
